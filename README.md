REXX interface to SalesBUILDER API

This is very old code I created in the late 90's to access SalesBUILDER from the REXX scripting language in OS/2.

The goal was to provide a command-line interface for SalesBUILDER that would allow a user to pass individual configurations or run sequentially through a series of confiurations to test.

As there were no real automated testing tools for the product. Using a command line, we could run through configurations automatically and check the results.
